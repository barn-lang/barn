New version of barn (0.2v) will have in it these things:
	- New type system
	- New types like (u8, u16, u32 etc.) just add more built-in 
          types to the language so we can operate on every value
	- Change the statements look so insted of
		. if |1 == 1| {
		. 	print("1 is 1, easy lol")
		. }
          We have something like this more modern and without some weird
	  characters, 'cause after all this time i see this syntax mistake
	  very well
		. if 1 == 1 {
		.	print("1 is 1, easy lol")
		. }
	- Also now for will look like this
		. for let i: int = 0; i < 100; i++ {
		. 	print("printing this hundred times")
		. }
	  So if, while, for look this same
	- Better Standard library, in 0.1v this library is very very obscured
	  and don't have all of the important functions, in 0.2v i want to 
	  expand built in libraries so you can do everything what you do in
	  C or any normal programming language without injecting C into Barn
	- Fix codegen, actually codegen is only one thing that is written pretty
	  good in whole barn but there's still some things that are not working well
	- Speeeeeeed, barn was suppose to be the fastes language in the world, it is
          but not the fastes of course. The speed in barn is not that tragic but not
	  the best over all
	- Fix that we can call functions inside the math expressions that is the biggest
	  bug in the barn and lots of people are terrified with it, i'm saying about this:
	  	. fun get_int() int {
		. 	return 1
		. }
		.
		. fun main() {
		. 	let the_int: int = get_int() // This will work
  		.       let the_int2: int = get_int() + 1 // But this wouldn't
		. }
	- Auto type in variables, so we don't need to write the type after let we will just
	  recognize the type by ourself

That's all we want to add to barn, if you want to help us in implementing all of it write to
me on discord, I will help you in getting into the source code!!
